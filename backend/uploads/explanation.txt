**Before:**

```
function sayHi() {
  console.log("ðŸ‘‹ Hello world");
}
```

This code defines a function called `sayHi` that logs "ðŸ‘‹ Hello world" to the console.

**After:**

```
sayHi()
```

This code calls the `sayHi` function, causing the message "ðŸ‘‹ Hello world" to be printed to the console.
